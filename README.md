## Intro

In this project I built an Active Directory Lab using VirtualBox. 

## Glossary

NIC: Network Interface Card. This is a hardware component that allows a computer/device to connect to a network such as a LAN (Local Area Network) or internet. 

DC: Domain Control. This is responsible for user authentication, access control, and management of network resources. 

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This is used to automatically assign IP addresses and simplifies network administration by eliminating the need for manual IP address assignments, allowing devices to obtain their network settings dynamically when they connect to the network. This protocol is used in home and business networks to efficiently connect phones, computers and printers.
